ESHOP PROJECT DEVELOPMENT STEPS

1. PROJECT SETUP
- Created the basic Flask application structure following Flask conventions:
  - app.py: Main entry point containing routes and application logic
  - templates/: Directory for HTML templates following Flask's Jinja2 templating system
  - static/: Directory for CSS, JavaScript, and image files
  - eshop/: Package directory for modular code organization

2. HOMEPAGE DEVELOPMENT
- Created a responsive homepage with the following sections:
  - Header with navigation and user actions (search, cart, account)
  - Hero section with a call-to-action button
  - Product recommendations section that will display personalized recommendations
  - Categories section to allow users to browse by product type
  - Footer with site information and links

3. DESIGN APPROACH
- Used a clean, modern design with a blue color scheme
- Implemented responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox for optimal viewing on all devices
- Applied KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) by:
  - Using semantic HTML5 elements for better structure and accessibility
  - Creating a straightforward user interface without unnecessary complexity
  - Focusing on core functionality (product display) without feature bloat
- Applied DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by:
  - Using reusable CSS classes (.container, .btn, etc.)
  - Creating consistent patterns for product cards and category cards
  - Implementing responsive design once with media queries

4. FLASK INTEGRATION
- Set up Flask routes to render the homepage
- Created a mock data structure for product recommendations that will be replaced with actual recommendation engine later
- Used Jinja2 templates to dynamically generate product cards from the data
- Configured static file serving for CSS and images

5. NEXT STEPS (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
- Add backend functionality for user authentication
- Implement product database and recommendation algorithm
- Create product detail pages
- Add shopping cart functionality
- Implement checkout process

6. UI IMPROVEMENTS (Commit: 2f975a7134e3fbb6d361cb3f32967d993c29aff4)
- Fixed product card button alignment issues using flexbox layout
- Implemented consistent card heights for better visual uniformity
- Used best practices for CSS layout:
  - Applied flexbox for vertical alignment and proper spacing
  - Created nested flex containers for content organization
  - Set fixed dimensions for consistent appearance across different content lengths
  - Used margin-top: auto to push buttons to the bottom regardless of content
  - Added dedicated product-content container for better structure
- Enhanced responsive design to maintain alignment across all device sizes
- Improved accessibility with better structure and semantic HTML

7. PRODUCT CONTENT STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS (Commit: d9f659c9ae0bfc794d0e7dd9cc6f64a8c4ed5a31)
- Enhanced product description and price alignment for consistent display
- Applied DRY principles by:
  - Creating a reusable product-content structure with fixed dimensions
  - Using common CSS classes for text elements with shared properties
  - Implementing standardized height values across all product cards
- Applied KISS principles by:
  - Simplifying the HTML structure with logical class naming
  - Using flexbox to automatically handle spacing and alignment
  - Setting consistent text truncation with line-clamping
- Fixed specific dimensions for product titles, descriptions and prices
- Added vertical alignment for price display
- Improved overall product card consistency regardless of content length

8. TITLE DISPLAY ENHANCEMENT (Commit: a03f167dd6bddfed5a6ceed2400af795ccde6397)
- Fixed issue with long product titles being hidden or truncated
- Improved title readability and display by:
  - Replacing fixed pixel height with flexible em units for title element
  - Increasing the line-clamp value from 2 to 3 lines for longer titles
  - Adding proper line-height for better text spacing and readability
  - Adjusting content area and card heights to accommodate longer titles
- Added test data with longer product titles to verify the solution
- Enhanced overall product card reliability with variable length content
- Maintained consistent layout while allowing more flexibility for product titles
